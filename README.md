Roguelike readme

This is a project I'm using to learn the curses library in python, and subsequently a couple of other libraries with it. 

Changelog:

        I did a bunch of stuff that I forgot to record because I am actually a vegetable
        
        added a broke ass requriements file. So much of this program is desperately in need of attention. It will get it, just perhaps not yet.
